To print table content to a PDF in Laravel 11, you can use the `laravel-dompdf` package, which simplifies the process of generating PDF documents from HTML views. First, you need to install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require barryvdh/laravel-dompdf
```

Next, you can create a view that contains your table structure. In your controller, create a method to generate the PDF:

```php
use PDF;

public function exportToPdf()
{
    $data = YourModel::all(); // Retrieve your data
    $pdf = PDF::loadView('your-view', compact('data')); // Load your view with data
    return $pdf->download('table.pdf'); // Download the PDF
}
```

Make sure to create a Blade view (`your-view.blade.php`) that formats your data into a table. Test the implementation to ensure it correctly exports all rows of data as intended.

Remember to double-check your implementation for any version-specific issues or changes.
